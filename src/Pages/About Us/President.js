                <p>Mrs. Kalindi Pandey (born in India, 1972) is the President of RSP Foundation, Noida (UP), India. She is a well-known social worker and has worked with people belonging to nearly every niche of Indian Society and Culture. She has a keen interest in social work and is dedicated to the solutions to every common man's problems. She has promoted many people for education, better health, and self-employment.

Soil, water, air, and all other natural resources are getting more toxic and contaminated day by day because people donâ€™t know about waste management. The maximum population of our country is becoming poorer to make few people richer because people are unaware of self-employment and social entrepreneurship. Farmers are committing suicide because agriculture has become a high labour and money-consuming, loss-making sector. Maximum children are suffering from malnutrition because they are consuming anything without knowing its nutritional value. Women are neither safe nor free to live their life happily at their workplace, roadside, and even in their home. This is just because people are unable to utilize the natural resources as well as the talented youth power in a constructive way. Besides this, people are neither able to deliver the latest technology and equipment to the farmers, nor to provide any platform for medical, social, technological, and legal consultancy to the needful people. To serve humanity, to be a part of social change, and to improve the lifestyle of needy people, she took up the charge as President of the RSP Foundation.</p>
